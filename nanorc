# nanorc - Initialization file for GNU nano.
#
# nano must be configured with --enable-nanorc for this file to be read.
# Do not use DOS or Mac line endings. Special characters (including quotes
# quotes inside of string parameters) should not be escaped. To make sure
# a value is disabled, use "unset <option>".

## Use auto-indentation.
# set autoindent

# Backup files to filename~.
set backup

## The directory to put unique backup files in.
# set backupdir ""

## Do backwards searches by default.
# set backwards

## Use bold text instead of reverse video text.

## The characters treated as closing brackets when justifying
## paragraphs.  They cannot contain blank characters.  Only closing
## punctuation, optionally followed by closing brackets, can end
## sentences.

# set brackets ""')>]}"

## Do case sensitive searches by default.
# set casesensitive

## Constantly display the cursor position in the statusbar.  Note that
## this overrides "quickblank".
set const

## Use cut to end of line by default.
set cut

## Set the line length for wrapping text and justifying paragraphs.
## If fill is 0 or less, the line length will be the screen width less
## this number.
##
# set fill -8

## Enable ~/.nano_history for saving and reading search/replace strings.
# set historylog

## The opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket
## searches.  They cannot contain blank characters.  The former set must
## come before the latter set, and both must be in the same order.
##
# set matchbrackets "(<[{)>]}"

## Use the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space.
set morespace

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,
## mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
## double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X
## Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.
##
# set mouse

## Allow multiple file buffers (inserting a file will put it into a
## separate buffer).  You must have configured with --enable-multibuffer
## for this to work.
##
set multibuffer

# set nonewlines

## Don't wrap text at all.
set nowrap

## Set operating directory.  nano will not read or write files outside
## this directory and its subdirectories.  Also, the current directory
## is changed to here, so any files are inserted from this dir.  A blank
## string means the operating directory feature is turned off.
##
# set operatingdir ""

## Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).
# set preserve

## The characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying
## paragraphs.  They cannot contain blank characters.  Only closing
## punctuation, optionally followed by closing brackets, can end
## sentences.
##
# set punct "!.?"

## Do quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear after
## 1 keystroke instead of 26.  Note that "const" overrides this.
##
# set quickblank

## The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.
## This is an extended regular expression if your system supports them,
## otherwise a literal string.  Default:
# set quotestr "^([ 	]*[#:>\|}])+"
## if you have extended regular expression support, otherwise:
# set quotestr "> "

## Fix Backspace/Delete confusion problem.
# set rebinddelete

## Fix numeric keypad key confusion problem.
# set rebindkeypad

## Do extended regular expression searches by default.
# set regexp

## Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the
## very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor
## will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the
## cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
## beginning of the line.
set smarthome

## Use smooth scrolling as the default.
# set smooth

## Enable soft line wrapping (AKA full line display). (nano >= 2.1.11)
<? print '# ' if $NANO_VERSION < 0x02010B ?>set softwrap

## Use this spelling checker instead of the internal one.  This option
## does not properly have a default value.
##
# set speller "aspell -x -c"

## Allow nano to be suspended.
set suspend

## Use this tab size instead of the default; it must be greater than 0.
# set tabsize 8

## Convert typed tabs to spaces.
# set tabstospaces

## Save automatically on exit, don't prompt.
# set tempfile

## Enable the new (EXPERIMENTAL) generic undo code, not just for line
## cuts.
# set undo

## Disallow file modification.  Why would you want this in an rcfile? ;)
# set view

## The two single-column characters used to display the first characters
## of tabs and spaces.  187 in ISO 8859-1 (0000BB in Unicode) and 183 in
## ISO-8859-1 (0000B7 in Unicode) seem to be good values for these.
# set whitespace "  "

## Detect word boundaries more accurately by treating punctuation
## characters as parts of words.
# set wordbounds
